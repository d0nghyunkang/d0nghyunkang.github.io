# Welcome

I am a PhD student at the Department of Finance, Copenhagen Business School. My research interests are empirical corporate finance, bankruptcy, and machine learning. You can find my CV [here](https://d0nghyunkang.github.io/files/CV_DonghyunKang.pdf) and a list of my ongoing projects below.


## Working papers

### Biased Judges? Judge Characteristics and Bankruptcy Outcomes

**Abtract**:
    Exploiting random assignment of judges to corporate bankruptcy filings, I examine the effect of judge characteristics on outcomes. First, I find that cases assigned to judges who grew up during the Great Depression are more likely to emerge from bankruptcy, whereas those assigned to judges with economics training and conservative political ideology are less likely to. Second, I show that case duration is shorter (longer) when the potential case outcome is consistent (inconsistent) with judges' preferences. Third, the judge characteristics do not correlate with post-emergence outcomes. Overall, the findings suggest that the effect of judge characteristics may be concentrated in marginal cases where the economic benefits of liquidation versus emergence are not significantly different. 
    
### Cartels and Managerial Accountability, with [Kasper Meisner Nielsen](http://www.kaspermeisnernielsen.com/)

**Abtract**:
    Cartels impose large loss to consumer welfare, yet we know little on whether and why price-fixing managers avoid accountability. We explore this by examining the likelihood of CEO turnover when an antitrust authority announces an unexpected cartel investigation. Only 12\% of the incumbent CEOs experience turnover within 1 year of investigation. We then investigate three governance mechanisms that may cause differences in accountability. First, consistent with stronger antitrust enforcement activities in EU, firms headquartered in Europe are more likely to fire CEOs, relative to the US firms. Second, I find that family-owned firms are less likely to dismiss their CEOs. Third, firms are more likely to fire CEOs who are more deeply involved in collusion. On the other hand, higher monetary sanctions against the firm have no effect on the turnover likelihood. Our results suggest that the managerial labor market provides insufficient incentives to deter cartel formation.
